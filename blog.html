		<p>We may define a food to be any substance which will repair the functional waste of the body, increase its growth, or maintain the heat, muscular, and nervous energy. </p>
		<p>BMU is a fully residential and co-educational university. Designed by world-renowned architects, HOK, USA, the 50-acre BMU campus has all the facilities and resources to ensure that you have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The campus has separate hostels and mess for boys and girls, a first-aid centre, an ambulance and doctor on call, cafeterias, an ATM,a general store, a book shop, and sporting facilities. The entire campus including the hostel is Wi-Fi enabled.</p>
		<p>The campus has been designed to seamlessly integrate academic spaces with recreational hang-outs. The objective is to encourage interaction among students, and foster the spirit of community living and learning. It’s a campus which encourages walking around, sitting out on the steps, and resting under the cool shade of a tree.Here, you will learn as much from your interactions with other students in student societies, debating clubs, and sporting facilities, as you will from course work in classes, labs, and workshops. Such exchanges will help you form enduring friendships and make your stay at BMU a memorable one.</p>
		<p>The campus offers a slew of recreational, fitness and sporting facilities. Besides indoor sporting facilities, the campus has tennis, volleyball, basketball, and badminton courts; a gym and a cricket-cum-football field. Qualified and experienced sports instructors are at hand to oversee the sports programmes and guide budding sportsperson.</p>

		<p>Unlike the traditional classroom experience where students are expected to compete with one another or remain uninvolved, especially where instructions are highly structured; students at BMU are given hands-on experiential learning situations in a more semi-structured approach.</p>
		<p>Classes are designed to engage students in hands-on experiences that are linked to real world problems and situations, including through extensive laboratory and workshop exposure, where the instructor facilitates rather than directs student progress.</p>
		<p>Although the learning content remains important, learning from the process through hands-on is at the core of the teaching process at BMU. In this process, students are guided to perform hands-on experience; share their observations with their peers; and discuss, analyse and reflect upon their experience. The instructor shall be the facilitator during the process of making the student realise and feel a sense of ownership for what he has acquired from the hands-on experience.</p>
		<h3>Flesh-formers, heat-givers, and bone-formers</h3>
		<p>Mineral matter is quite as necessary for plant as for animal life, and is therefore present in all food, except in the case of some highly-prepared ones, such as sugar, starch and oil. Children require a good proportion of calcium phosphate for the growth of their bones, whilst adults require less. The outer part of the grain of cereals is the richest in mineral constituents, white flour and rice are deficient. Wheatmeal and oatmeal are especially recommended for the quantity of phosphates and other salts contained in them. Mineral matter is necessary not only for the bones but for every tissue of the body.</p>
		<p>When haricots are cooked, the liquid is often thrown away, and the beans served nearly dry, or with parsley or other sauce. Not only is the food less tasty but important saline constituents are lost. The author has made the following experiments:—German whole lentils, Egyptian split red lentils and medium haricot beans were soaked all night (16 hours) in just sufficient cold water to keep them covered. The water was poured off and evaporated, the residue heated in the steam-oven to perfect dryness and weighed. After pouring off the water, the haricots were boiled in more water until thoroughly cooked, the liquid being kept as low as possible. The liquid was poured off as clear as possible, from the haricots, evaporated and dried. The ash was taken in each case, and the alkalinity of the water-soluble ash was calculated as potash (K2O). The quantity of water which could be poured off was with the German lentils, half as much more than the original weight of the pulse; not quite as much could be poured off the others.</p>
		

		<blockquote>A comparatively small quantity of proteid matter, such as is easily obtained from vegetable food, is ample for the general needs of the body.</blockquote>
		<p>Flesh contains no starch or sugar, but a small quantity of glycogen. The fat in an animal is derived from the carbohydrates, the fats and the proteids of the vegetables consumed. The soil that produced the herbage, grain and roots consumed by cattle, in most cases could have produced food capable of direct utilisation by man. By passing the product of the soil through animals there is an enormous economic loss, as the greater part of that food is dissipated in maintaining the life and growth; little remains as flesh when the animal is delivered into the hands of the butcher. Some imagine that flesh food is more easily converted into flesh and blood in our bodies and is consequently more valuable than similar constituents in vegetables, but such is not the case. Fat, whether from flesh or from vegetables is digested in the same manner. The proteids of flesh, like those of vegetables, are converted into peptone by the digestive juices—taking the form of a perfectly diffusible liquid—otherwise they could not be absorbed and utilised by the body. Thus the products of digestion of both animal and vegetable proteids and fats are the same. Formerly, proteid matter was looked upon as the most valuable part of the food, and a large proportion was thought necessary for hard work. It was thought to be required, not only for the construction of the muscle substance, but to be utilised in proportion to muscular exertion. These views are now known to be wrong. A comparatively small quantity of proteid matter, such as is easily obtained from vegetable food, is ample for the general needs of the body. Increased muscular exertion requires but a slight increase of this food constituent. It is the carbohydrates, or carbohydrates and fats that should be eaten in larger quantity, as these are the main source of muscular energy. The fact that animals, capable of the most prolonged and powerful exertion, thrive on vegetables of comparatively low proteid value, and that millions of the strongest races have subsisted on what most Englishmen would consider a meagre vegetarian diet, should have been sufficient evidence against the earlier view.</p>
